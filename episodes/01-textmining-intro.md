## About

This site contains a GitHub repository of files for a a workshop in text mining using Python programming, as well as Voyant Tools and DH-Lab tools. The latter consists of web applications and Jupyter Notebooks with Python example code to text mine the National Library of Norway, whereas the former can be used to text mine any corpus, with proper preprocessing of the data.

The episodes on programming with Python to text mine are adapted from the Library Carpentry: Data & Text Mining: https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-tdm/aio/index.html

I also maintain the UiO Library's webpages on text mining:

- [Types of text mining and digital analysis of text](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/text-mining/text-mining-types.html)

"Text Mining is the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources... The difference between regular data mining and text mining is that in text mining the patterns are extracted from natural language text rather than from structured databases of facts." - [from What is Text Mining?](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/text-mining.html) by [Marti Hearst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marti_Hearst)
