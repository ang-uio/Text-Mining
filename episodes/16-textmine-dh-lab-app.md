## Introduction to Text Mining with DH-Lab with apps

Keypoints:
- DH-Lab has made web-based apps for a simpler introduction to text mining the National Library's collection. 
- The apps are built on top of the DH-Lab API, using Streamlit, a free and open-source app framework in Python. 
- Among the apps are tools to search for concordances, collocations, N-gram and word frequencies, Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Part-of-Speech tagging, and Topic Modelling.

To use an app to text mine the National Libraryâ€™s digitized collections:

- Go to the app page at [DH-Lab](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/) and select the app for the type of text mining you want to do. 
- You first need to build a corpus using the corpus app. You can drag and drop the corpus you build to the app for the type of text mining you want to do.
