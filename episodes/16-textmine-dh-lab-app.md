## Introduction to Text Mining with DH-Lab with apps

Keypoints:
- DH-Lab has made web-based apps for a simpler introduction to text mining the National Library's collection. 
- The apps are built on top of the DH-Lab API, using Streamlit, a free and open-source app framework in Python. 
- Among the apps are tools to search for concordances, collocations, N-gram and word frequencies, Named Entity Recognition (NER) & Part-of-Speech tagging, and Topic Modelling.

To use an app to text mine the National Libraryâ€™s digitized collections:

- Go to the app page at [DH-Lab](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/) and select the app for the type of text mining you want to do. 
- You first need to build a corpus using the corpus app. 
- You can then drag and drop the corpus you build to the app for the type of text mining you want to do.

## Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Named Entity Recognition (NER) tries to find out whether a word is a named entity (NE) or not. Named entities are definite noun phrases that refer to specific types of individuals, such as organizations, persons, dates, and so on. Entity recognition is often performed using chunkers, which segment multi-token sequences, and label them with the appropriate entity type. Common entity types include ORGANIZATION, PERSON, LOCATION, DATE, TIME, MONEY, and GPE (geo-political entity). Part-of-speech tags are often a very important feature when searching for chunks. NLTK provides a classifier that has already been trained to recognize and tag named entities; you can read more about it in the [NLTK textbook](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch07.html#named_entity_recognition_index_term).
