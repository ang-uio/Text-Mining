## Text Mining with Voyant Tools

Keypoints:
- Voyant is user friendly and accepts a large variety of formats with little preprocessing.
- Voyant offers a range of rich plots, graphs, and networks. 


[Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) is an open-source, web-based application for performing automated computational text analysis on documents. It can be used to analyze online texts you link to and texts you upload, and it accepts a number of different file formats, such as docx, pdf, txt, etc. Voyant is popular among scholars in the digital humanities and has a large, international user base. It does not perform linguistical text analysis such as part-of-speech tagging or named entity recognition, but is highly user friendly, provides nice visualizations, and has a rich functionality. See [the list of tools](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/tools) here.

Acknowledging the limitations of its pre-programmed functionalities, Voyant welcomes users to develop their own tools using Voyant's functionality and code, and endorses the use of other tools, in particular Python with Jupyter Notebook.
