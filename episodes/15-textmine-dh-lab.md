## Introduction to Text Mining with DH-Lab Jupyter Notebooks with example Python code 

Keypoints:

The [DH-Lab](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/) at the National Library of Norway has written example code to text mine the National Library’s huge digitized collection, and it is developing web-based apps for a simpler introduction to text mining the National Library's collection. The code is written in Python and shared in Jupyter Notebook, and the apps are made using Streamlit, a free and open-source app framework in Python.

Access DH-Lab Apps and Notebooks at [nb.no/dh-lab](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/).

To run code to text mine the National Library’s digitized collections:
- Download example notebook from DH-Lab. Begin witht the first before selecting notebook based on type of text mining.
- Download and install Anaconda. 
- Open Anaconda, launch Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda, and open the downloaded notebook. 
- Begin at the top of the downloaded notebook and follow the instructions. 
- Run all cells in the notebook.
