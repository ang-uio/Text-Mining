## Introduction to Jupyter Notebook

This course teaches programming in Python to text mine. It uses the application [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) from the navigator [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as the environment for Python. The Natural Language Toolkit, [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data ("natural language processing" or NLP), also comes with Anaconda as one of many packages and libraries you can select to install and run in Jupyter Notebook, and will be used in this course. Python, Jupyter, and NLTK are open source and free.

Once the new notebook opens you can give it a name by changing the word "Untitled" in the first line of the new notebook that opens up. You can see and change the location for where the notebook is saved in the browser window, see also the finder menu. 

You will see the first cell in your new notebook.  You can enter python code into this cell and press "Run" as long as it is marked as "Code" in the menu at the top of your notebook.  This will run your code and you will see any output created by the code immediately below it.
