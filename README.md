This repository contains the files for a a workshop in text mining using Python programming, as well as Voyant Tools and DH-Lab tools. The latter consists of web applications and Jupyter Notebooks with Python example code to text mine the National Library of Norway. Python and Voyant, on the other hand, can be used to text mine any corpus, though preprocessing the data is typically requeired, especially for Python.

The episodes on programming with Python to text mine are adapted from the Library Carpentry: Data & Text Mining: https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-tdm/aio/index.html
