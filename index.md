## Welcome to this Introduction to Text Mining!

[What is text mining?](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/text-mining/)

"Text Mining is the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown information, by automatically extracting information from different written resources... The difference between regular data mining and text mining is that in text mining the patterns are extracted from natural language text rather than from structured databases of facts." - [from What is Text Mining?](https://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hearst/text-mining.html) by [Marti Hearst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marti_Hearst)

Why text mining? Automated search strategies can provide an overview of patterns and tendencies in large volumes of text. This may provide insight that would otherwise be difficult to achieve, time-consuming or both through conventional qualitative methods.

## Please consult:

[Types of text mining and digital analysis of text](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/text-mining/text-mining-types.html)

[Tools and software bundles for text mining](https://www.ub.uio.no/english/libraries/dsc/research-methods/text-mining/tools-software-bundles.html)

Text mining requires readable big data. In this course, we will pay particular note to the value of platforms such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/), a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data, and [DH-Lab](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/), which facilitates text mining of the entire digitized collection of the National Library of Norway. 

More and more archives have their own tools to text mine their collections, with or without subscription. Some familiarity with programming is often necessary, typically in Python. Most of this course is therefore devoted to getting a fundamental competence of the Python programming langauge.

Learning a programming language is like learning any new language. It requires copying, repeating, using a dictionary, practicing, learning enough of the 'grammar' of the language to detect typos and mistakes.

A key in learning to master a programming language, is learning how to look things up. Therefore in this course you will become familiar with the practice of looking things up and becoming familiar with some of the most relevant ([textbooks](https://ang-uio.github.io/Textmining/#recommended-readings), [published tutorials](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/?search=python), [online resources](https://github.com/sgsinclair/alta/blob/2eb10ab6787d032e317ce883fb0bc3427406333d/ipynb/Useful%20Resources.ipynb), and [forums](https://stackoverflow.com/)).

With a competence in Python, comes a deeper understanding of web applications for text mining, including [DH-Lab Tools](https://www.nb.no/dh-lab/) and [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/about) which this course also will make you familiar in using. 

> **Learning goals:**
> 
> - Get a fundamental understanding of how the Python program works (the math behind it with strings and loops etc.).
> 
> - Get a fundamental understanding for how Python code can be used to text mine.
>
> - Get a fundamental understanding for how the web applications from DH-Lab and Voyant can be used to text mine.

## Recommended and required readings
Book Chapters: 
- [Natural Language Processing with Python: Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/book/). The book is recommended as a whole. Required chapter readings are [1. Language Processing and Python](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html), [2. Accessing Text Corpora and Lexical Resources](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html), and [3. Processing Raw Text](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch03.html).
- [Humanities Data Analysis: Case Studies with Python](https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/index.html). This book is also recommended as a whole. Required chapter readings are the sub chapters of DATA ANALYSIS ESSENTIALS, including the Introduction, Parsing and Manipulating Structured Data, and Exploring Texts using the Vector Space Model, see in particular ["What you should know"](https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/introduction-cook-books/notebook.html#what-you-should-know)(on variables, strings, loops, lists, dictionaries, conditional expressions (if, elif, else), and reading files) and on [data formats](https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/getting-data/notebook.html#plain-text) and [preprocesing](https://www.humanitiesdataanalysis.org/vector-space-model/notebook.html#text-preprocessing).
